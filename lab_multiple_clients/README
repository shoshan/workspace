lab_multiple_client_server

extended solution to home lab from gby embedded linux programming.
supports multiple clients connection disconnection and transmition.

lab has two excutables :
  lab_multiple client: give commands to server - r/q/c  
              and print server response , 
              if no server the client retry with TO.
              r- reset count 
              q- quit 
              c- tell what is the count 
  lab_multiple_server: server waiting to command from multiple_clients ( only one client)
